This design  ensures internal validity, since differences in take-up can be credibly linked to the intervention rather than preexisting household traits. However, the experiment’s focus on landowning households in areas served by BASIX (more affluent populations) limits how well the results generalize to poorer or less-connected populations. Also, not all assigned households were reached, which weakens the precision of treatment effects. The study also measures only immediate purchase decisions, leaving open questions about long-term use of insurance.\n"

        "**Propensity Score Matching (PSM)** is  used to estimate the effect of a treatment by matching treated units with control units that have similar characteristics. The propensity score, typically estimated using [logistic regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression), represents the probability of receiving the treatment based on observable covariates. By matching units with similar propensity scores, PSM helps balance the treatment and control groups, reducing bias in observational studies and allowing for a more accurate estimation of the treatment effect. This method ensures that differences in outcomes are primarily due to the treatment rather than confounding variables."

        "The [`matchit`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MatchIt/vignettes/MatchIt.html) package in `R` offers a range of functions to perform **PSM** analysis. The following code performs matching using a logistic regression model (logit) to estimate propensity scores. The analysis includes all treated units and excludes control units that fall outside the region of common support, ensuring comparability between the groups. The argument `discard = \"control\"` specifies that control observations outside the common support region are discarded. After matching, you can visualize the balance between treatment and control groups by plotting the histogram of propensity scores. Detailed matching results can be accessed using the `summary()` function."
